The system enables users to send text messages via a Telegram Bot, which are instantly retrieved by an ESP8266 WiFi module, processed by an Arduino Uno, and displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen. This prototype mirrors real-world applications such as railway station information boards, smart home notification panels, and industrial monitoring systems.
